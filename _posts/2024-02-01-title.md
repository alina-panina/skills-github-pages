So, today we're going to discuss, who are my all time favorite anime characters and why do I like them. First, I would like to ask the audience: why wouldn't you like them? They're strong, the're hot, they have interesting personalities
and at the end of the day they show to be good of heart (or, well, in Hisoka's case - just not necessarily bad).
